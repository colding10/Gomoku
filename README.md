<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

`Kingfish` is a UCI chess engine built in C++. It was written from scratch, however it was inspired by Stockfish and Sunfish, two very popular chess engines. The engine was roughly estimated via the [chess.com](http://chess.com) Stockfish ELO estimator to about 2000 ELO. Additionally, on [lichess.org](http://lichess.org), [it's rating](https://lichess.org/@/KingfishBot) is about 2000 ELO.

> __I created a lichess account! Play Kingfish here: https://lichess.org/@/KingfishBot.__

The engine supports __most but not all of the common UCI commands__. It is tailored to work with Cute Chess, an application for playing UCI chess engines.

__The engine plays a very capable and competitive game of chess. It blunders once in a while however, and there are a few kinks to be worked out.__

## Usage

Kingfish is a software program designed for playing chess on a computer. However, it lacks a graphical user interface (GUI) which is necessary to visually display a chessboard and to facilitate the input of moves. Third-party developers have created separate GUIs that can be found online. To use Kingfish with a particular GUI, consult the documentation provided with that GUI for instructions on integrating the two applications.

Kingfish speaks UCI, a protocol for chess engines. See `engine-interface.txt` for a description of the UCI protocol.

## Roadmap

* [X] Convert program (GUI) into CLI
* [X] Implement basic engine interfaces (UCI)
* [X] Play test games and debug
* [ ] _Improve engine_
  * [ ] Add bitboards
  * [ ] Bitwise storage of moves and pieces
  * [ ] Avoid copying positions
  * [ ] Threading
* [ ] Implement all engine interfaces (UCI)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/colding10/Kingfish/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

<!-- LICENSE -->

## License

Kingfish is free and distributed under the
[GNU General Public License version 3][license-url] (GPL v3). Essentially,
this means you are free to do almost exactly what you want with the program,
including distributing it among your friends, making it available for download
from your website, selling it (either by itself or as part of some bigger
software package), or using it as the starting point for a software project of
your own.

The only real limitation is that whenever you distribute Kingfish in some way,
you MUST always include the license and the full source code (or a pointer to
where the source code can be found) to generate the exact binary you are
distributing. If you make any changes to the source code, these changes must
also be made available under GPL v3.
